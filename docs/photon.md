# Photon (iMessage) channel

Photon connects NanoClaw to **iMessage** through [Photon][photon] — a managed
service that owns the iMessage line, delivery, and abuse-prevention, so you
don't have to run your own Mac relay. Photon's free tier uses a shared iMessage
line pool, so anyone can get started without a paid plan.

This is a **first-party native channel**: the adapter (`src/channels/photon.ts`)
ships in trunk and is wired into the channel barrel. It's dormant until
credentials exist — install it with `/add-photon`.

## Architecture

Like Discord and Slack, Photon is a **persistent-connection** channel — no
public URL, no webhook, no signing secret. The `spectrum-ts` SDK holds a
long-lived **gRPC stream** to Photon for both directions.

NanoClaw's host runs on Node, and `spectrum-ts` is a TypeScript SDK, so the SDK
runs **in-process on the host** — there is no Python sidecar (as in Hermes,
whose gateway is Python) and no loopback HTTP. `deliver()` / `setTyping()` call
the SDK directly; a re-subscribing consumer loop drains the inbound stream.

```
                       gRPC (spectrum-ts, in-process)
┌─────────────────────────┐  ◄───────────────►  ┌──────────────────────────┐
│  Photon Spectrum cloud  │   app.messages       │  NanoClaw host (Node)    │
│  (iMessage line owner)  │   space.send()       │  src/channels/photon.ts  │
└─────────────────────────┘                      └──────────┬───────────────┘
                                        onInbound / deliver  │  ▲
                                                             ▼  │
                                                   router / delivery pipeline
```

- **Inbound** — the SDK's `app.messages` async iterator yields
  `[space, message]` pairs. The adapter normalizes each into an
  `InboundMessage` (text, downloaded attachments, reaction markers) and hands
  it to the router via `onInbound`. If the stream ends or errors, the consumer
  loop re-subscribes with capped exponential backoff.
- **Outbound** — `deliver()` resolves the target space (a DM by phone number
  via `space.create`, or a group by its opaque space id via `space.get`) and
  calls `space.send(markdown | text | attachment | voice | typing)`.

## Credentials

Runtime SDK credentials live in `.env` (host-side; **never** enter a
container — delivery is host-side, and the container-runner does not mount
`.env` into agent containers):

```bash
PHOTON_PROJECT_ID=<spectrum project id>   # the SDK's projectId
PHOTON_PROJECT_SECRET=<project secret>
```

The device-login bearer token used during setup is cached in
`data/photon-auth.json` (mode `0600`) so re-running the wizard reuses it.

## Setup

The `/add-photon` skill does everything; the frictionless core is the wizard:

```bash
# 1. install the runtime SDK (pinned — spectrum-ts ships breaking majors)
pnpm install spectrum-ts@8.0.0

# 2. run the setup wizard (device login + auto-provision everything)
pnpm exec tsx scripts/photon-setup.ts --phone +15551234567
```

`scripts/photon-setup.ts` does, in order:

1. **Device login** (RFC 8628, `client_id=photon-cli`) — prints a URL + code,
   opens your browser, and polls until you approve. Talks only to Photon's
   dashboard HTTP API — it does not import `spectrum-ts`, so it works before the
   runtime SDK is installed.
2. **Find or create** the `NanoClaw` project on the Photon dashboard.
3. **Mint the project secret** (the dashboard reveals it once) and write
   `PHOTON_PROJECT_ID` + `PHOTON_PROJECT_SECRET` to `.env`.
4. **Register your phone** as a Spectrum user (idempotent — skipped if already
   present).
5. **Surface the assigned iMessage line** — the number you text to reach your
   agent.

Everything is idempotent: re-running reuses the stored token/project and only
fills gaps, so it's safe to finish a partial setup. `pnpm exec tsx
scripts/photon-setup.ts status` shows what's configured.

After setup, restart the service so the adapter connects, then text the
surfaced number once and wire the DM to an agent with `/init-first-agent`
(the wizard prints a ready-to-run command).

## Configuration

All optional, set in `.env`:

| Env var | Default | Meaning |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `PHOTON_PROJECT_ID` | — (required) | Spectrum project id (SDK `projectId`) |
| `PHOTON_PROJECT_SECRET` | — (required) | Project secret |
| `PHOTON_MARKDOWN` | `true` | Send agent replies as markdown (iMessage renders it natively). `false` sends plain text. |
| `PHOTON_TELEMETRY` | `false` | Enable Spectrum SDK telemetry |
| `PHOTON_MAX_INLINE_ATTACHMENT_BYTES` | `20971520` (20 MB) | Max inbound attachment size the adapter reads + caches |
| `PHOTON_DASHBOARD_HOST` | `https://app.photon.codes` | Dashboard API host (setup wizard) |
| `PHOTON_SPECTRUM_HOST` | `https://spectrum.photon.codes` | Spectrum API host (setup wizard) |

## Platform ids

- **DMs** are direct-addressable: the `platform_id` is the counterpart's bare
  E.164 number (e.g. `+15551234567`), and the user id is `photon:+15551234567`.
  No channel prefix (see `src/platform-id.ts`).
- **Groups** use the opaque Spectrum space id, discovered on first message.

## Features

- **Markdown** — replies are sent via the SDK's `markdown()` builder; iMessage
  renders bold/italics/lists/code natively. `PHOTON_MARKDOWN=false` reverts to
  plain text.
- **Inbound attachments & voice notes** — read off the stream and cached to
  `data/attachments/`, surfaced to the agent as structured `attachments` (with
  a `[… could not be downloaded]` note on failure). Over-cap media is skipped.
- **Outbound attachments** — files are written to a temp path and sent via
  `space.send(attachment(...))`.
- **Reactions (tapbacks)** — `send_reaction` maps to an iMessage tapback;
  inbound tapbacks arrive to the agent as `reaction:added:<emoji>`.
- **Approval questions** — `ask_user_question` renders as text with
  `/approve` / `/reject` slash-command replies (iMessage has no buttons). A
  matching reply routes to the approval handler instead of waking the agent.
- **Typing indicators** — sent while the agent is working.

## Upgrading spectrum-ts

`spectrum-ts` is pinned to an **exact** version in `package.json` because the
SDK ships breaking majors (v8 is what the adapter targets). Upgrades are
deliberate:

1. Read the [SDK release notes][releases] for every version between the current
   pin and the target.
2. Bump the exact pin and run `pnpm install`.
3. Reconcile `src/channels/photon.ts` against the new typings. The adapter uses
   `Spectrum`, the `imessage` provider, the `text` / `markdown` / `typing` /
   `attachment` / `voice` content builders, and `space.send` /
   `space.getMessage` / `message.react`.
4. Run `pnpm run build` and `pnpm exec vitest run src/channels/photon.test.ts`.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `spectrum-ts is not installed` at setup | `pnpm install spectrum-ts@8.0.0`, then restart |
| Device login times out | Re-run the wizard (the code expires in ~30 min; a stored token is reused) |
| No iMessage line assigned | Re-run `… photon-setup.ts status` or check the [dashboard][photon]; the shared line can take a moment |
| Inbound stops arriving | The adapter re-subscribes automatically; if it persists it's usually upstream — restart to force a fresh stream |
| Bot silent | Check `grep "Photon channel connected" logs/nanoclaw.log`, that the channel is wired, and that the service is running |

Compared to the community `/add-imessage` skill (Photon in "remote mode" via
the Chat SDK bridge), this native adapter talks to Photon directly, supports
outbound attachments and tapbacks, and ships the provisioning wizard.
